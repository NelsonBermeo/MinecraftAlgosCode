# Linked Lists

We know that a normal list can be visualized as a continous block of cells in memory and that we can look up a value with
an index in constant time because we know the starting place of the list in memory we just add the index and get the value: 

A Linked List on the other hand instead of continous memory its data is stored across memory in nodes. A Linked List is a
node based data structure. You can think of a node in the case of a Linked List as a class with 2 attributes. These two attributes 
are the data the node holds, and a pointer to the next node in the list. Here is a visualization the memory:

Here is a visualization of the nodes: 

In this level you'll learn about why a Linked List is advantagous at times, a implementation from scratch of a LL, an example 
of where Linked Lists are used in real life, problems and solutions to Linked List related Leetcode problems and different
kinds of linked lists.
